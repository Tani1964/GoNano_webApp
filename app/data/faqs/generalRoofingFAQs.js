      question: "How long has nanotechnology been around?",
      answer: "Nanotechnology has been studied and developed for several decades. Commercial applications for surface protection have been refined and proven effective over the past 10-15 years, with continuous improvements in formulation and application methods."
    },
    {
      question: "What is nanotechnology, and how does GoNano use it?",
      answer: "Nanotechnology involves manipulating materials at the molecular level (1-100 nanometers). GoNano uses specialized nano-particles that bond at the molecular level with your roof, wood, or concrete surfaces to create an invisible protective barrier that repels water and resists damage without changing the appearance of your surfaces."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the warranty for GoNano roof treatments?",
      answer: "GoNano roof treatments come with a comprehensive warranty that covers the protection for multiple years. The specific warranty terms depend on the type of surface and application. Contact us for detailed warranty information specific to your project."
    },
    {
      question: "Has the roofing product been independently tested?",
      answer: "Yes, GoNano products have undergone rigorous independent testing by certified laboratories to verify their effectiveness, durability, and safety. These tests confirm water repellency, UV resistance, and long-term performance characteristics."
    },
    {
      question: "Will GoNano void my shingle manufacturer warranty?",
      answer: "No, GoNano treatments are designed to be non-invasive and do not alter the structural integrity of your shingles. Our application process and formulation have been verified to maintain compliance with major shingle manufacturer warranties."
    },
    {
      question: "Does GoNano do minor repairs to the roof before treatment?",
      answer: "Yes, we perform a thorough inspection before treatment and can address minor repairs as needed. This ensures the treatment is applied to a sound surface for optimal performance and longevity."
    },
    {
      question: "Is GoNano safe for people, pets, and plants?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Once cured, GoNano treatments are completely safe for people, pets, and plants. Our formulations are eco-friendly and contain no harsh chemicals that could harm your family or the environment."
    },
    {
      question: "Is GoNano's treatment visible after application?",
      answer: "No, GoNano treatments are completely invisible. The nano-particles work at the molecular level, so there's no coating, film, or color change. Your surfaces maintain their original appearance while gaining superior protection."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take GoNano to cure?",
      answer: "The curing process typically takes 24-48 hours, depending on temperature and humidity conditions. During this time, the nano-particles bond with the surface at the molecular level to create lasting protection."
    },
    {
      question: "Is rain a problem after application?",
      answer: "Light rain after the initial curing period (usually 4-6 hours) is not a problem. We monitor weather conditions carefully and will schedule applications during optimal weather windows to ensure proper bonding and curing."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do GoNano roof treatments last?",
      answer: "GoNano roof treatments typically last 5-10 years, depending on environmental conditions and roof type. The molecular bond ensures long-lasting protection that doesn't wash away or degrade like traditional coatings."
    },
    {
      question: "Does GoNano change the color of the roof?",
      answer: "No, GoNano treatments are completely transparent and will not change the color or appearance of your roof in any way. The protection is invisible while being highly effective."
